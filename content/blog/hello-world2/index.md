description: "You'll feel at home in this 'rustic' venue with locally-sourced American eats, Texas brewskies & an outdoor patio for you live music yearnings."

Inspired by the flavors of Texas, this Uptown restaurant/bar plates an elevated menu of Southern-inspired fare, with an eye toward seasonal and local ingredients and frequent use of the kitchen's smoker. The country music's always on, including live performances on the indoor stage that overlooks the expansive dining room or the outdoor stage facing a sprawling patio.
